# This is a utility script for building the plugin DLL. This script should not be run in CI, we expect the plugin DLL to be manually built before you commit your changes.
# In cases where all changes are localized to go files, this script does not need to be run.
# This script must be run on a Windows host, since we are building a DLL using .NET Framework
# If we migrate the CCG plugin to pure golang, we can remove this script.
